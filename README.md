# Chicago Data Analysis

## Description:
This repo includes my submissions for weeks 5 & 6 of the Coursera course titled [Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science/)

## Assignments:
* Week 5: You have been hired by an organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and young people in Chicago. Your job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. You will identify causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools.

* Week 6 (Bonus Assignment): You must download each dataset (available in the repo), create a table for each one in IBM's Db2 cloud database, and load the appropiate dataset through the Db2 console. This exercise includes using joins, creating a view, creating a stored procedure, and using those stored procedures in ACID transactions.
